# neuralnetwork
1.Customized neural network using R2019b matlab consisting of multiple layers based on the
IEEE paper (An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer By Timothy Oâ€™Shea, and Jakob Hoydis).  
2.Generated data according to the modulation required for the transmitter using one hot encoded vector. 
3.Fed data along with dense layers to the customized Neural network and trained the network along with 
IFFT and FFT predefined matlab functions. 
4.Validated the trained data with the generated data.
5.Optimized the network with low BitErrorRate and best Accuracy
